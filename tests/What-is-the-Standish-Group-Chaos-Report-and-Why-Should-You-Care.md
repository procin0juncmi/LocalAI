## How Does the Standish Group Chaos Report Measure Project Success?
 
The Standish Group Chaos Report uses three criteria to measure project success: OnTime, OnBudget, and OnTarget. These criteria reflect the traditional project management approach of meeting the predefined scope, schedule, and cost objectives. A project is considered successful if it meets all three criteria, challenged if it meets one or two criteria, and failed if it meets none.
 
However, the Standish Group Chaos Report also recognizes that these criteria are not enough to capture the true value and satisfaction of software projects. Therefore, it introduces two additional criteria: OnGoal and Value. These criteria reflect the agile project management approach of delivering value to the customer and meeting their goals. A project is considered successful if it meets both criteria, challenged if it meets one criterion, and failed if it meets none.
 
The Standish Group Chaos Report also uses a new definition of success called Modern Resolution, which combines both traditional and agile criteria. A project is considered successful if it is OnTime, OnBudget, and has a satisfactory result. A project is considered challenged if it is not OnTime or OnBudget but has a satisfactory result. A project is considered failed if it does not have a satisfactory result.
